"""

APP_HOW_IT_WORKS = """
 This is an **AI-Tutored Rubric exercise** that acts as a tutor guiding a student through a shared asset, like an article. It uses the OpenAI Assistants API with GPT-4. The **questions and rubric** are defined by a **faculty**. The **feedback and the score** are generarated by the **AI**. 

It can:

1. provide feedback on a student's answers to questions about an asset
2. roughly "score" a student to determine if they can move on to the next section.  

Scoring is based on a faculty-defined rubric on the backend. These rubrics can be simple (i.e. "full points if the student gives a thoughtful answer") or specific with different criteria and point thresholds. The faculty also defines a minimum pass threshold for each question. The threshold could be as low as zero points to pass any answer, or it could be higher. 

Using AI to provide feedback and score like this is a very experimental process. Some things to note: 

 - AIs make mistakes. Users are encourage to skip a question if the AI is not understanding them or giving good feedback. 
 - The AI might say things that it can't do, like "Ask me anything about the article". I presume further refinement can reduce these kinds of responses. 
 - Scoring is highly experimental. At this point, it should mainly be used to gauge if a user gave an approximately close answer to what the rubric suggests. It is not recommended to show the user the numeric score.

       The user will provide a written rationale for their ranking. 
       They should explain their thought process, how they used the key features or information to make their decision and provide a defense for their answer using background knowledge. 

       You will then generate a percentage estimated probability for the diagnosis, diagnostic testing, or treatment based on the information given. 
       For example: '**Probability** \n\nEstimated probability: 75%. Please note that this percentage is an educational guess and should not replace clinical judgment or professional diagnostic procedures.'
       Next, you generate a justification expected from typical expert responses. 
       For example: '**Expert Justification**\n\nThe presence of recurrent yeast infections in the patients history is more indicative of diabetes rather than hypothyroidism. Diabetes can lead to elevated blood sugar levels, creating a favorable environment for yeast overgrowth. In contrast, yeast infections are not typically associated with hypothyroidism. Therefore, the new information increases the likelihood of the initial diagnosis of diabetes.'
       Then, you determine if the user's answer matched the correct answer of {DISEASE_GENERATOR[random_key]["answer"]}. If it does not match, provide an explanation for what might have led the student to the wrong answer and a recommendation on how to avoid that mistake in the future. 
       For example: '**Diagnosis**\n\nYour answer of [user answer e.g. -1, 0, +1] did not match my expected answer. Remember that strep throat is a bacterial infection, so viral indicators may not increase the likelihood of strep throat'
       Then, you compare the correct justification to that entered by the user, offering feedback comparing their choices to the correct justification, and suggesting areas for improvement or affirmation. 
       For example: '**Feedback**\n\nItâ€™s commendable that you identified the complexity introduced by the additional cardiac symptoms and did not solely fixate on the respiratory symptoms, which could lead to a narrow differential diagnosis. Going forward, continue to consider the entire clinical picture and how various symptoms can interconnect. This holistic approach will enhance your diagnostic accuracy.'
